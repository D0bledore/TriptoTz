## Features to Test

This section outlines the testing procedures for the key features of the project, focusing on the **Quiz** and **Filter** functionalities. The aim is to ensure these features work as intended, providing users with a seamless and engaging experience.

- **Quiz**: An interactive component that guides users through a series of questions to determine their ideal travel experience.
- **Filter**: A feature that allows users to explore all potential travel options and refine their choices based on specific criteria.

## Testing Procedures

### Quiz 

**Navigation to Quiz**:

- I verifed that the quiz can be accessed via the "Find Your Perfect Trip" button on the landing  page and the header navigation link.

- It's important to point out that clicking these options reveals the quiz section without resetting it, allowing users to switch between the quiz and filter sections seamlessly.

**Quiz Functionality**:

- I confirmed that clicking "Take the Test!" starts the quiz and reveals the first set of options (relaxation, adventure, education) along with a new image.
- I verified that each option (relaxation, adventure, education) generates three new buttons and updates the image accordingly.
- I made sure that each subsequent button press continues to reveal new options and images without any console errors.

###  Filter

**Accessing the Filter**:

- After completing the quiz, I navigated successfully to the filter section with the 'Search all Results' Option. 

**Filter Options**:

- I checked that the buttons for popular destinations 'Serengeti' and 'Zanzibar' are working.  
- I tested the "Clear Text" and "All Options" buttons to ensure they facilitate easy filtering and enhance the user experience.
- I checked that clicking the filter results button for 'Relaxation', 'Adventure', and 'Education' are working and providing accurete results, matching the Quiz Final Results. 
- I tested each button with multiple clicks to ensure that bug free buttons. 

### Additional Features for Testing

#### Navigation Features
        
**Call to Action**: 

I tested that the landing page's call-to-action options effectively starts the quiz.
        
**Menu Navigation**:

I can verify that the menu allows easy switching between the quiz and the filter section on desktop and tablet devices.
        
**Mobile Dropdown**:

I tested the mobile menu dropdown, it is working. 

**Home Button**:

I confirmed that the logo functions as a home button, allowing users to return to the homepage or refresh the site.

**Up-Button**:

- I verified that the "Go up!" option successfully apears at a certain time when scrolling. I tested it on mobile and desktop devices.
- I tested the 'Go up!' button to sucessfully take the user to the top of the page. 

**Error Page**:

- I tested the custom error page by entering an incorrect URL, ensuring it displays the intended image and provides a hyperlink back to the homepage.
- I tested that the hyperlink takes the user back to index.html page. 

### Conclusion

I ensure that all interactive elements and navigation features are thoroughly evaluated for functionality and user experience.


## Code Validation

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

## Browser Compatibility

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various browsers.

Consider testing AT LEAST 3 different browsers, if available on your system.

You DO NOT need to use all of the browsers below, just pick any 3 (minimum).

Recommended browsers to consider:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)

- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested browsers, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Please note, there are services out there that can test multiple browser compatibilities at the same time.
Some of these are paid services, but some are free.
If you use these, you must provide a link to the source used for attribution, and multiple screenshots of the results.

Sample browser testing documentation:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

## Responsiveness

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.

If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well.
It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

Sample responsiveness testing documentation:

## Lighthouse Audit

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

## Defensive Programming

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

MS3 (Flask) | MS4/PP4/PP5 (Django):
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable.
Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website.
Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine,
consider documenting tests on each element of the page
(ie. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their happy flow,
and also the bad/exception flow, mentioning the expected and observed results,
and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

Consider using the following format for manual test cases:

Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented

- **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
- **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
- (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
- (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
- **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."

Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| Page | Expectation | Test | Result | Fix | Screenshot |

Another way of performing defensive testing is a simple Pass/Fail for each test.
The assessors prefer the above method, with the full test explained, but this is also acceptable in most cases.

When in doubt, use the above method instead, and delete the table below.
